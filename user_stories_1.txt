As a customer, I am looking for a web-app that can...

	1. Handle the scheduling of a several simultaneous contracts.
	2. Display the contracts in an easy to read format with due dates clearly defined in a combined calendar view.
	3. Contain a map view of all current contracts with features such as LAT/LON data input.
	4. Combine several different types of information into one easy format.
	5. Ability to scan in documents to the contract.
	
Secondary Features

Other features that I hope are included...

	1. The ability to have a checklist of prerequisites for each dig-site.
	2. The inclusions of different "moderator" and "user" views.
	3. The ability to show "red-lines" on a map that designate boundaries.
	4. Powerful and intuitive interface that requires to little to no training.
